The cpu.c is the BEST CPU program that supports MIPS ISA machine
code execution. The target of this BEST CPU is to support all
MIPS instructions so that user can use cross compiler to compile
user program to MIPS ISA machine code.

The program supports machine code file input so as to run user
defined program. The machine code should be put into a file
without any space, tab and comments. Each line of it should be
32-bit HEX code. Example (same as in 'test' file):
2009003f
01205021
ad490000
8d4b0000
2008003e
20090003
ad090000
8d100000
8d520000
ad120000
ad500000

# test is the machine code file; test.asm is MIPS assembly code

When launching the CPU, use the following commands to execute:
 - Without assigning any machine code file, run default test case:
	./cpu

 - With assigning a machine code file, run the input test case:
	./cpu test
	./cpu bootloader

DEBUG:
 - There are a few define inside the cpu.c that gives debugging info:
	#define		value		meaning
	DEBUG		0 or 1		Turn OFF or ON debugging information
	DEBUG_LEVEL	0 ~ 5		0 - highest level; 5 - lowest level
