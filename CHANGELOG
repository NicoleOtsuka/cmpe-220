HW3:
 * Added standard JUMP and BRANCH instructions of MIPS ISA.
 * Added a unique LEA instruction (from IA32).
   (Created a new type for LEA instruction by following the equation:
    rd = rs + rt * shamt + funct;)
HW2:
 * Added stack pointer that uses ADDI to move the pointer up and down.
 * Added full ALU support, implemented by using bitwise operations only.
HW1:
 * Added an initial implementation of a MIPS architecture CPU.
 * Only supports the basic SW, LW, MOVE (ADDU) instructions.
